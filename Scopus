PROJECT NAME : IIPS_INT_2131_PREDICTING LIFE EXPECTANCY USING MACHINE LEARNING

                  PROJECT SCOPE DOCUMENT
1.PROJECT SUMMARY:
  A Typical regression Machine Learning project leverages historical data to predict insights into the future. This problem statement
  is aimed at predicting Life Expectancy rate of a country given various features.
  
  Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time a human heing is expected to live. Life expectancy depends on various
  factors : Regional variations,Education,Year of their birth,Economic circumstances, Sex Differences, Mental Illness,Physical 
  Illness and other demographic factors. This problem statement provides a way to predict average life expectancy of people living in a 
  country when various factors such as year, GDP , education,alcohol intake of people in the country,expenditure on healthcare system and 
  some specific disease related deths that happened in the country are given.
  
2.PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:
    2.1: FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
      Predicting the life expectancy rate of a country.
      Creating the data model present on the database.
      Merge the model to the edge devices.
    2.2 TECHINICAL REQUIREMENTS: 
    Python,IBM Cloud,IBM Watson.
    2.3 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:
    Processor : i3 7th gen or higher
    Speed : 2Ghz or more
    HardDisk space : 10gb or more
    
3. PROJECT DELIVERABLES: 
    Once the model is refined, model conversion takes place. It is a step that is required when developing models that are to be used 
    within edge devices such as mobile phones or IoT devices. A node red application will be developed for this model.
